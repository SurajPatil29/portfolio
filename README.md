- Hi, I'm Suraj Patil from Maharashtra. I hold a diploma in
          Electrical Engineering and have transitioned into tech, gaining
          proficiency in Frontend Development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
          and React, along with basic DSA concepts. With hands-on
          experience in creating frontend projects, I am passionate
          about continuous learning and honing my skills in web
          development.
